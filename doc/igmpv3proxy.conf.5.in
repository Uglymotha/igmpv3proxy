.SH NAME
igmpv3proxy.conf \- Configuration file for
.BR igmpv3proxy (8)
multicast daemon

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B igmpv3proxy.conf
contains the configuration for the 
.B igmpv3proxy
multicast daemon. It defines which network interfaces should be
used by the routing daemon. Each interface must be give one of the following roles:
.B upstream
,
.B downstream
or
.B disabled
.

The
.B upstream
network interface is the outgoing interface which is responsible for communicating
to available multicast data sources. There can only be one upstream interface.

.B Downstream
network interfaces are the distribution interfaces to the destination networks, 
where multicast clients can join groups and receive multicast data. One or more
downstream interfaces must be configured.

On
.B disabled
network interfaces all IGMP or multicast traffic is ignored altogether. If multiple
IP addresses is used on one single interface (ae. eth0:1 ...), all interface
aliases not in use should be configured as disabled.

Any line in the configuration file starting with
.B #
is treated as a comment. Keywords and parameters can be distributed over many lines.

.B defaultdown
.RS
Set interfaces on system to downstream by default.
.RE

.B defaultthreshold / defaultratelimit
.RS
These paramters control default values for threshold and ratelimit for downstream interfaces.
.RE

.B proxylocalmc
.RS
IANA defines the range 224.0.0.0/8 as local multicast range, which should not be forwarded.
Setting this options enables forwarding of this range if needed. If enabled the range will
be checked just like other groups against the black- and whitelists for interfaces.
.RE

.B quickleave
.RS 
Enables quickleave mode. In this mode the daemon will send a Leave IGMP message
upstream as soon as it receives a Leave message for any downstream interface.
The daemon will then ask for Membership reports on the downstream interfaces, 
and if a report is received the group is joined again upstream. Normally this
is not noticed at all by clients on the downstream networks. If it's vital
that the daemon should act exactly as a real multicast client on the upstream
interface, this function should not be used. Disabling this function increases
the risk of bandwidth saturation.
.RE

.B rescanvif
.I secs
.RS
Enables periodic rescanning of interfaces in system. Interfaces which have dissapeared are
removed and new interfaces added to the proxy interfaces.
The value is a timer (in seconds) with a minimun of 1 second, 0 means disabled.
.RE

.B rescanconf
.I secs
.RS
Enables periodic rescanning of configuration file.
The value is a timer (in seconds) with a minimun of (Query Response) seconds, 0 means disabled.
.RE

.B loglevel
.I level
.RS
Sets the Unix loglevel for the daemon, value 1 - 7.
.RE

.B logfile
.RS
Specifies a dedicated logfile to use. The logfile is not rotated by igmpv3proxy.
.RE

.B noquerierelection
.RS
Disables IGMP querier election mechanism.
.RE

.B queryinterval, queryresponseinterval, robustnessvalue
.RS
Sets the values for queries (in s) and robustness. Beware, do not change these
parameters unless you absolutely need to and absolutely know what you are doing.

.RS
Defines the state and settings of a network interface.
.RE

.SH PHYINT OPTIONS

.B interface
.RS
The name of the interface the settings are for. This option is required for
phyint settings.
.RE

.B role
.RS
The role of the interface. This should be either
.B upstream
(only one interface),
.B downstream
(one or more interfaces) or
.B disabled
\&. This option is required.
.RE

.B ratelimit
.I limit
.RS
Defines a ratelimit for the network interface. If ratelimit is set to 0 (default),
no ratelimit will be applied. This setting is optional.
.RE

.B threshold
.I ttl
.RS
Defines the TTL threshold for the network interface. Packets with a lower TTL than the 
threshols value will be ignored. This setting is optional, and by default the threshold is 1.
.RE

.B allowednet (or altnet)
.I networkaddr
\&...
.RS
Defines alternate sources for multicasting and IGMP data. The network address must be on the 
following format 'a.b.c.d/n'. By default the router will accept data from sources on the same
network as configured on an interface. If the multicast source lies on a remote network, one
must define from where traffic should be accepted. 

This is especially useful for the upstream interface, since the source for multicast
traffic is often from a remote location. Any number of altnet parameters can be specified.
.RE

.B deniednet
.I networkaddr
\&...
.RS
Defines explicitly blacklisted sources for interface. The network address must be on the 
following format 'a.b.c.d/n'.
.RE

.B whitelist
.I networkaddr
\&...
.RS
Defines a whitelist for multicast groups for interface. The network address must be in the following
format 'a.b.c.d/n'. If you want to allow one single group use a network mask of /32,
i.e. 'a.b.c.d/32'. 
.RE

.B blacklist
.I networkaddr
\&...
.RS
Defines explicitly blacklisted multicast groups for interface. he network address must be in the following
format 'a.b.c.d/n'.
.RE

.SH BLACK & WHITELISTS
By default all multicast groups are allowed on any downstream interface. If at least one
whitelist entry is defined, all igmp membership reports for not explicitly whitelisted
multicast groups will be ignored and therefore not be served by igmpv3proxy. This is especially
useful, if your provider does only allow a predefined set of multicast groups. These whitelists
are only obeyed by igmpv3proxy itself, they won't prevent any other igmp client running on the
same machine as igmpv3proxy from requesting 'unallowed' multicast groups.

You may specify as many whitelist entries as needed. Although you should keep it as simple as
possible, as this list is parsed for every membership report and therefore this increases igmp
response times. Often used or large groups should be defined first, as parsing ends as soon as
a group matches an entry.

You may also specify whitelist entries for the upstream interface. Only igmp membership reports
for explicitly whitelisted multicast groups will be sent out on the upstream interface. This
is useful if you want to use multicast groups only between your downstream interfaces, like SSDP
from a UPnP server.

Besides whitelist it is also possible to define blacklists for explicitely blakclisted sources and
multicast groups on an interface. The blacklist / deniednet will be checked after the whilteist / allowednet.
This makes it possible to define a large range as whitelist, while still being able to blacklist subranges.
Even though it is possible to alternate between whilteists and blacklists in configuration of an interface, 
both lists are parsed in it's entirety. Whitelist will always be checked before blacklist.
See 
.BI EXAMPLES
on how to configure black and whitelists.
